# Medical Data Extraction System

## Overview

This project is a **Medical Data Extraction System** that processes and extracts structured information from unstructured medical text files. The system reads patient medical records stored in a `data.txt` file, which includes details such as symptoms, diagnoses, medications, and recommendations. It then structures the data in a way that makes it easier to analyze, store, or visualize.

## Features
- **File Parsing**: Reads medical records stored in plain text files.
- **Data Structuring**: Converts unstructured text data into a structured format (e.g., dictionary).
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing or malformed data.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily extended or integrated into larger health data systems.

## Requirements

To run the project, you need:
- **Python 3.x**
- Libraries:
  - os (for file handling)
  - json (optional, for saving data in JSON format)

You can install the required dependencies by running:
